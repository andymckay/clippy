This is a work in progress, probably won't work.

An example add-on to demonstrate copy and paste.

To run this, you'll need to set the extensions.webextensions.remote to true.

For example:

  web-ext run --pref extensions.webextensions.remote=true

Things this add-on should demonstrate:

* copy and paste through a background script (working)
* paste through a keyboard shortcut
* paste through a context menu
* copy and paste an image
